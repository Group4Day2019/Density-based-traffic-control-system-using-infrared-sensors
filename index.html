        <div class="ksdka">
            <div class="jkx">Why is it a two way?</div>
            <div class="ksfs">We believe that whatever we develop, creates impact</div>

            <div class="ksdf">What we are working on Currently</div>
            <div class="lasdal">The Current System</div>
            <div class="kdfjk">The current System is a one way because it uses only one fuctionality which is the fixed time delay</div>
        </div>
        <div class="ksdfna">
            <h5 class="dskfsl">How is this problem</h5>
            <p class="sdfmn">Its a problem in such away that during the rush hours you can find a green light on an empty road yet a road flooded with Vechicles has a red light on it</p>
        </div>
        <div class="knvdv">
            <h1 class="sklfm">Good News</h1>
            <p class="sdfnd">Our system is a two in one why because it has two functionalities which are both the fixed time delays and infrared sensors which are used to detect density of vechicles on the road</p>

            <h2 class="ksfnsdf">Simple description of how the System works</h2>
            <p class="adiewr">if its normal traffic flow at the junction our system uses fixed time delays to control the movement vechicles on the road. If vechicles start increasing on some roads at the junctions then the sensors come into play</p>
        </div>
        <div class="jkdfk">
            <h5 class="kfnsdfs">Information about the team creating the System</h5>
            <p class="owewe">Currently the system is a finished prototype(System demostration) which will be implemented if approved by authorities and the government/organisation is willing to invest in it below are the team members
